# Simple Web Quiz Application

This project provides the foundational structure for a simple, interactive web quiz. It leverages standard web technologies to present a user interface for multiple-choice questions, along with an architectural blueprint for expanding into additional modules like a calculator. It serves as a clear demonstration of frontend development principles and project organization. 🚀

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SireTallest/ALX_Simple_Quiz.git
    ```
2.  Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ALX_Simple_Quiz
    ```

### Usage

To view the static quiz interface, simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. While the core structure for the quiz and a calculator module are in place, the JavaScript logic for dynamic interactions and the CSS styling are intended for future implementation.

To view the main quiz page:
1.  Locate `index.html` in the root of the cloned directory.
2.  Right-click on `index.html` and choose "Open with" -> "Your Web Browser" (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
